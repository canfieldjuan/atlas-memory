ATLAS Distributed System - Nodes


Node #1 orange pi 5 plus
location - 5th Street
purpose - security

From office PC you can always reach the Pi at: ssh canfieldjuan@100.95.224.113
or by Tailscale hostname: ssh canfieldjuan@orangepi-atlas 
  
These work regardless of what LAN the Pi is on — Tailscale handles NAT traversal automatically. 
The only requirements are that both machines have Tailscale running and connected.
